        Here is a user-given task and the agent steps: {agent_memory.get_succinct_steps()}. Now here is the FINAL ANSWER that was given: 
        {final_answer}
        Ensure the FINAL ANSWER is in the right format as asked for by the task.  Here are the instructions that you need to evaluate:
        YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. 
        If you are asked for a number, don't use commas to write your number.  Don't use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. Write your number in Arabic numbers (such as 9 or 3 or 1093) unless specified otherwise.
        If you are asked for a currency in your answer, use the symbol for that currency.  For example, if you are asked for the answers in USD, an example answer would be $40.00
        If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. 
        If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.
        If you are asked for a comma separated list, ensure you only return the content of that list, and NOT the brackets '[]'
        First list reasons why it is/is not in the correct format and then write your final decision: PASS in caps lock if it is satisfactory, FAIL if it is not.
